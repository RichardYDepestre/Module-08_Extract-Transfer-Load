# Movies ETL (Module 8 Challenge)

## Project Overview: 
#### This challenge is reinforce the ETL concept that we have learned last week.
#### Using the Pandas and Regex we have been able to load the content of external files into memory. With the same libraries we have created scripts that sanitizes the data into meaning bits of information.
#### To cap the challenge, we uploaded the cleansed data onto a sqlite database. We found that the ratings tables houses 26,024,289 entries where as the movies tables accounted for 6052 rows.
